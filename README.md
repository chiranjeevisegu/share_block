Since this is a local-only version, there is no live demo link. Users can run it by following the installation instructions below.

‚ú® Features
Client-Side Encryption: Files are encrypted in the browser using AES. Your private files and password never leave your machine.
Time-Locked Access: Set files to "self-destruct" after a specific duration (1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week), making them permanently inaccessible after the time expires.
Proof of Existence: Generates a digital notary certificate with a timestamp and a unique SHA-256 hash, providing cryptographic proof that your file existed at a specific time.
No Backend Required: The local version runs entirely in the browser with zero dependencies, making it incredibly portable and private.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
Libraries: CryptoJS
Deployment: Runs locally in any modern web browser.
